```
Several of the challenges are dynamic and require you to talk to our challenge servers over the network. This allows you to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on people trying to communicate, or directly attack a vulnerable service. To keep things consistent, our interactive servers always send and receive JSON objects.  
  
Such network communication can be made easy in Python with the `pwntools` module. This is not part of the Python standard library, so needs to be installed with pip using the command line `pip install pwntools`.  
  
For this challenge, connect to `socket.cryptohack.org` on port `11112`. Send a JSON object with the key `buy` and value `flag`.

Connect at `socket.cryptohack.org 11112`
```

The challenge offers a premade script which requires editing to successfully solve the task. Instead of using the premade script, I made my own:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

host = 'socket.cryptohack.org' # Define the remote host to connect to
port = 11112 # Define the remote port to connect to

conn = remote(host, port) # Use pwntools to create a connection
print(conn.readline().decode('utf-8')) # Receive the initial greeting and output it

conn.send(b'{"buy":"flag"}') # Send the JSON value to the remote process
output = conn.readall() # Recieve the answer
print(output.decode('utf-8').strip()) # Cleanup the answer and output it
```

**Note: You'll need to install pwntools to run this script. You can install it using the following command: `python3 -m pip install pwntools`**

The script first defines the host and port to which to connect. Following that, I used pwntools' `remote()` function to create a connection to the remote host. The `print(conn.readline().decode('utf-8'))` does a lot of things, it first reads any data that the remote process might have sent to us (it uses the `readline()` function to achieve that), after reading the data, it decodes the data using `.decode()`. Decoding the data is not necessary, but it makes the output pretty (basically it transforms \n into an actual newline). Finally, the decoded that is output to the screen via `print()`.

The second part of the script sends the required JSON data. The `b` prefix is used to tell python and pwntools to send the data as bytes. After sending the data, we again have to receive the response this time using the `readall()` function (https://docs.pwntools.com/en/dev/tubes.html#pwnlib.tubes.tube.tube.recvall) (additional note: readall() == recvall()). Finally, formatting is done using the functions `decode()` and `strip()`, allowing the data to be outputted out in readable format.

The flag for this challenge is: `crypto{sh0pp1ng_f0r_fl4g5}`
